Run the server exe first then run the client exe. 

Controlled are wasd, mouse to shoot, the bullet goes in the trajectory of the player and mouse.  

To control a player individually it needs to be separate machines.

You can have 0 to 4 clients connected at once, it can run on the localhost and LAN.  
The clients find the server with a broadcast message from the server so they should find the server on any LAN, on any machine. 
It should be able to run on 5 separate machines, but I only managed to test it with 2 machines.
